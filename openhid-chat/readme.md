# OpenHID Chat

An extended version of RocketChat with features to help the lab work faster.

## Features

- **Trello Scrum Integration** - Finished cards alert the team, automatic biweekly scrum reset, and unfinished cards are placed in the backlog.

- **Hours Report** - `\checkin` will check you in for that day, and `\checkout` will check you out, this will alert the team about your status (by default, if you don't checkout, you'll be logged for 10 hours). This will automatically fill in your hours on MyFIU as well as prepare an email report for your supervisors. 

- **Github/Gitlab Integration** - Any changes to the group are reported.

- **Google Calendar** - The team will be reported on any deadlines for conferences or events we're having.
